# dracula
`dracula` is a c++ project where i implement machine learning algorithms from scratch for learning purposes. right now it includes linear regression built completely from scratch.

## SCREENSHOT
![ml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0023ea9-d15d-4e3d-b08e-b5cd9211a85c)


THE PROGRAM:
- reads dataset from a csv file
- trains the model in real time
- shows the best fit line updating live
- plots the error for each epoch
- uses imgui for visualization

this project is not meant to be used by others.  
it exists purely for my own learning and understanding of how machine learning works internally.

## CURRENT FEATURES
- linear regression
- gradient descent
- csv data loading
- real-time visualization
- error graph per epoch

## TECH STACK
- c++
- imgui
- opengl / glfw (if applicable)

## GOAL
the goal is simple:
understand machine learning by building everything myself.
